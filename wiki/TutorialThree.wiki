The example below demonstrates how to query a specific server in a domain. Normally Python-AD uses ''serverless binding'', which means that Python-AD will select a suitable domain controller automatically. Sometimes however this is not what you want and instead you want to target a specific domain controller. This is possible with Python-AD. The example below again lists the search user functionality, but now it specifically targets the domain controller with the PDC emulator (Primary Domain Controller emulator) role.

{{{
from ad import Client, Creds, Locator, activate

domain = 'freeadi.org'
user = 'Administrator'
password = 'Pass123'

creds = Creds(domain)
creds.acquire(user, password)
activate(creds)

locator = Locator()
pdc = locator.locate(domain, role='pdc')

client = Client(domain)
users = client.search('(objectClass=user)', server=pdc)
for dn,attrs in users:
    name = attrs['sAMAccountName'][0]
    print '-> %s' % name
}}}
